# Image-Orientation-detection-correction-project
This repository has my first image detection project using Pillow and Py-tesseract 
it uses an OCR to first detect all the text in the image then calculate its orientation to correct it using simple rotation function and substraction 


It is recommended to use a virtual environment instead of directly downloading the libraries to your local PC as the downloaded libraries may hinder with other processes of your system and a virtual environment is a useful way of ensuring that the correct package/library versions are consistently used every time the software runs. Virtual environments also help ensure that the results from running code are reproducible

use ctrl+` to open up the terminal in VScode

To create a virtual environment use the following lines of code:

python -m venv env  #env is the name of the directory where the virtual environment is created u can use any name

then to activate the virtual environment use the following:

.\env\Scripts\activate

then install all the dependencies of the code

to deactivate the environment simply type deactivate in the terminal

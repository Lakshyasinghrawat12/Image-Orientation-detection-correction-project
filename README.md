# Image-Orientation-detection-project
This repository has my first image detection project using Pillow and Py-tesseract 

It is recommanded to use a virtual environment instead of directly downloading the libraries to your local PC as they're useful ways of ensuring that the correct package/library versions are consistently used every time the software runs. Virtual environments also help ensure that the results from running code are reproducible
